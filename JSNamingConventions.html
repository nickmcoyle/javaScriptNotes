<h1>This document will cover the naming conventions for variables, classes, and functions in JavaScript</h1>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
camelCase: capitalizes the first letter of each word excluding the first word and removes spaces between words
PascalCase: capitalizes the first letter of each word including the first word and removes spaces between words
UPPERCASE: all letters are capitalized and spaces between words are removed

<i>*Note</i>: Whether or not you use camelCase or PascalCase, all names should begin with a letter and be descriptive of their purpose. For example, poorly named variable: var x = 0; //the name x tells us nothing about what this variable does
versus a well named variable: var speedingTickets = 0; //very descriptive

<h5>camelCase uses:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>variable names</li>
	<li>function names excluding constructor functions</li>
  </ul>

<h5>PascalCase uses:</h5>
  <ul>
	<li>constructor functions</li>
  </ul>
